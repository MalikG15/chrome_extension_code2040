# Chrome_Extension_CODE2040

This chrome extension connects to CODE2040's API. It bypasses Chrome's CORS policy due to the fact that is it an extension, and in the manifest file CODE2040's API has been declared as a permissible access point.

# .gitignore

The .gitignore file contains my private token key to connect to the API.
